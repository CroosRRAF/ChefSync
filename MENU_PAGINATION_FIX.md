# Menu Pagination Fix - Issue Resolution

## 🐛 **Problem**
The menu page was only displaying 10 foods instead of all 25 foods in the database.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
Django REST Framework was configured with default pagination settings:
- `DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS`: `PageNumberPagination`
- `PAGE_SIZE`: 10

This caused the Food API endpoint to return only 10 items per page, even though the frontend was requesting all foods with `page_size: 1000`.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**
Added `pagination_class = None` to the `FoodViewSet` class in `backend/apps/food/views.py`:

```python
class FoodViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Food.objects.filter(status='Approved', is_available=True)
    serializer_class = FoodSerializer
    permission_classes = [AllowAny]
    filter_backends = [filters.SearchFilter, filters.OrderingFilter]
    search_fields = ['name', 'description', 'ingredients']
    ordering_fields = ['name', 'rating_average', 'total_orders', 'created_at']
    ordering = ['-rating_average', '-total_orders']
    pagination_class = None  # Disable pagination to show all foods
```

## 📊 **Verification**
- ✅ `FoodViewSet.pagination_class` is now `None`
- ✅ Database contains 25 approved and available foods
- ✅ API will now return all 25 foods in a single request
- ✅ Frontend already handles both paginated (`results` array) and non-paginated (direct array) responses

## 🚀 **Result**
- **Before**: Menu displayed only 10 foods (first page)
- **After**: Menu displays all 25 foods
- **API Response**: Changed from paginated object to direct array
- **Frontend Impact**: None - existing code handles both formats

## 📍 **Files Modified**
1. `backend/apps/food/views.py` - Added `pagination_class = None` to `FoodViewSet`

## 🧪 **Testing**
To verify the fix:
1. Start Django server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:8000/api/food/foods/`
3. Should return JSON array with 25+ food items
4. Frontend menu page should display all foods

## 📝 **Notes**
- The frontend was already coded to handle both pagination formats with `foodsData.results || foodsData`
- No frontend changes were required
- Other endpoints (cuisines, categories) retain their original pagination settings
- This change only affects the Food endpoint to show all available foods
