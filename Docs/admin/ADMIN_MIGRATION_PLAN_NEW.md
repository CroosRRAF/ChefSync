## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks:

1. **Breaking existing functionality** - Keep old code until new system is fully tested
2. **Performance degradation** - Monitor bundle size and optimize continuously
3. **API compatibility issues** - Test all backend integrations thoroughly
4. **User adoption challenges** - Maintain similar UI patterns where possible

### Rollback Plan:

- Keep old admin system in `srcOLD/` as backup
- Maintain old routing as fallback option
- Document all breaking changes
- Create quick revert procedures
