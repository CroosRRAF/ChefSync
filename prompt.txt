Project Setup
1.	Create a new branch: feature/admin-dashboard
2.	Set up folder structure for frontend (/client/admin) and backend admin APIs (/server/admin or Django apps)
3.	Pull latest changes from main before starting work
4.	Confirm Python/Django + Node.js versions with your team to avoid env mismatches
5.	Create .env file for storing API keys (AI service, DB config, etc.)

API & Data Planning
1.	List all admin features & required API endpoints (orders, revenue, chefs, AI summaries, etc.)
2.	Confirm data shape (JSON format) for each API response with backend team
3.	Identify which data will be real-time (needs frequent updates) vs static
4.	Plan how AI will get the data (direct from DB or from processed API endpoint)
5.	Decide authentication method (JWT tokens via DRF or Django sessions)

Authentication & Access Control
1.	Backend: Create admin role in Django (group or permission-based)
2.	Frontend: Redirect non-admin users away from admin pages
3.	Protect admin routes (React Router + auth check)
4.	Add logout & session expiry handling

Core Admin UI Pages
1.	Dashboard Home
	Quick stats cards: Total Orders, Revenue, Active Chefs, Pending Approvals
	Charts: Sales trends, Top dishes
2. User Management
	List, approve/reject chefs
	Block/unblock users
3. Menu Management
	Add/update/remove dishes
	Stock alerts
4. Order Management
	View orders by status
	Assign delivery partner
5. Delivery Partner Management
	Approve/reject delivery partners
	Assign/reassign deliveries

AI Features Integration
1.	Test API responses in Postman/Insomnia
2.	Test role-based access (admin vs non-admin)
3.	Test dashboard layout on different screen sizes
4.	Test AI output with dummy data and real data
5.	Check error handling (e.g., API fails, AI service unavailable)

Deployment Prep
1.	Merge feature/admin-dashboard into main after review
2.	Remove console logs & unused code
3.	Store AI API keys securely (env variables, not in code)
4.	Ensure Django Admin is still available for dev team
5.	Document admin dashboard features for final presentation/demo
