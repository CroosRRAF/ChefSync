# VS Code Cache Clear Instructions

## Problem
VS Code is showing TypeScript errors for files that don't exist (GoogleRegisterButton.tsx).

## Quick Solution
1. **In VS Code Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):
   - Type: `TypeScript: Restart TS Server`
   - Run this command

2. **If still showing errors**:
   - `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Developer: Reload Window`

3. **Clear all caches** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   rm -rf dist
   npm run dev
   ```

## Verification
- ✅ File doesn't exist: `GoogleRegisterButton.tsx` 
- ✅ TypeScript compiles: `npx tsc --noEmit` (no errors)
- ✅ App builds successfully: `npm run build` works
- ✅ App runs: Frontend server on http://localhost:8081/

## The Real Status
The errors you're seeing are **cache artifacts** - not real code problems. The application is working correctly.

## Focus on Google OAuth
The main issue to focus on is the Google OAuth 404 error, which requires updating your Google Cloud Console with the correct redirect URIs:

**Add to Google Cloud Console:**
- JavaScript Origins: `http://localhost:8081`
- Redirect URIs: `http://localhost:8081`

The TypeScript "errors" are just VS Code cache issues that don't affect functionality.
