# ChefSync Order System Fixes and Enhancements

## Summary of Changes

### 🔧 **Fixed Order Placement Issue**
- **Problem**: Order placement API was failing due to decimal/float mixing in calculations
- **Solution**: Updated all monetary calculations to use `Decimal` type consistently
- **Files Modified**: `backend/apps/orders/views.py`
- **Functions Fixed**: 
  - `place_order()` - Lines 1000-1010
  - `calculate_checkout()` - Lines 890-900

### ✨ **Implemented Order Cancellation Feature**
- **Feature**: Added ability to cancel orders within 10 minutes of placement
- **Endpoints Added**:
  1. `POST /api/orders/orders/{id}/cancel_order/` - Cancel an order with reason
  2. `GET /api/orders/orders/{id}/can_cancel/` - Check if order can be cancelled and get remaining time
- **Files Modified**: `backend/apps/orders/views.py`
- **New Methods**:
  - `cancel_order()` - Handles order cancellation with 10-minute window validation
  - `can_cancel()` - Returns cancellation eligibility and remaining time

### 🛠️ **Configuration Fixes**
- **Problem**: ALLOWED_HOSTS was not including 'testserver' for testing
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/config/settings.py` to include testserver
- **Change**: Added 'testserver' to ALLOWED_HOSTS list

## 📝 **API Documentation**

### Place Order
```http
POST /api/orders/place/
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "chef_id": 1,
  "delivery_latitude": 19.076,
  "delivery_longitude": 72.8777,
  "customer_notes": "Special instructions",
  "chef_latitude": 19.076,
  "chef_longitude": 72.8777,
  "chef_address": "Kitchen address",
  "chef_city": "City"
}

Response:
{
  "success": "Order placed successfully",
  "order_id": 4,
  "order_number": "ORD-ADF38FF7",
  "status": "pending",
  "total_amount": 88.5
}
```

### Cancel Order
```http
POST /api/orders/orders/{id}/cancel_order/
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "reason": "Changed my mind"
}

Response:
{
  "success": "Order cancelled successfully",
  "status": "cancelled",
  "refund_status": "pending",
  "message": "Your refund will be processed within 3-5 business days"
}
```

### Check Cancellation Eligibility
```http
GET /api/orders/orders/{id}/can_cancel/
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}

Response:
{
  "can_cancel": true,
  "time_remaining": "9 minutes 45 seconds",
  "time_remaining_seconds": 585
}
```

## 🔄 **Order Status Flow**

```
cart → pending → confirmed → preparing → ready → out_for_delivery → delivered
                ↓
              cancelled (within 10 minutes only)
```

## 💡 **Business Logic**

### Pricing Calculation
- **Subtotal**: Sum of all cart items
- **Tax**: 10% of subtotal  
- **Delivery Fee**: 
  - ₹50 for distance ≤ 5km
  - ₹50 + (extra_km × ₹15) for distance > 5km
- **Total**: Subtotal + Tax + Delivery Fee

### Cancellation Rules
- ✅ Can cancel if status is 'pending' or 'confirmed'
- ✅ Must be within 10 minutes of order placement
- ✅ Must be the customer who placed the order
- ✅ Requires cancellation reason
- ✅ Automatically sets refund status to 'pending'

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Production**

1. **Payment Integration**: Implement actual payment processing
2. **Notification System**: Send emails/SMS for order updates
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live order tracking
4. **Admin Panel**: Enhanced order management interface
5. **Analytics**: Order performance metrics and reporting

## ✨ **Summary**

- ✅ **Fixed order placement** - No more decimal/float errors
